# System Architecture

The FreeIPA Workshop Deployer is built using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, with a modular architecture that ensures flexibility and maintainability.

## Key Components

### 1. Infrastructure Layer

- **Providers:**
  - AWS (EC2, Route53, VPC)
  - DigitalOcean (Droplets, DNS)
  - kcli (local virtualization)
- **Configuration:** Managed through Terraform scripts
- **Features:**
  - Multiple provider support
  - Automated resource provisioning
  - Infrastructure state management

### 2. Configuration Layer

- **Ansible Playbooks:** 
  - Automate FreeIPA server configuration
  - Handle DNS setup and user provisioning
  - Manage certificates and security settings
- **Modules:**
  - Package installation
  - Service management
  - File manipulation
  - System configuration

### 3. DNS Management

- **Dynamic DNS:**
  - Python-based implementation
  - Ansible playbook integration
  - Profile-based configuration
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic updates
  - Profile-based management
  - Cloud provider integration

## Architecture Patterns

### Modular Design
- Components are loosely coupled
- Easy to maintain and scale
- Flexible provider support

### Infrastructure as Code
- All infrastructure defined in code
- Version-controlled configurations
- Reproducible deployments
- State management

### Configuration Management
- Consistent system configurations
- Automated deployments
- Idempotent operations
- Role-based organization

### Dynamic DNS Management
- Flexible DNS configurations
- Profile-based management
- Automated updates
- Provider integration

## Key Technical Decisions

### Terraform Selection
- Robust infrastructure provisioning
- Multi-provider support
- State management capabilities
- Strong community support

### Ansible Implementation
- Powerful configuration management
- Easy to understand YAML syntax
- Extensive module library
- Agentless architecture

### Python Integration
- Dynamic DNS management
- Extensive standard library
- Rich ecosystem of packages
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Shell Scripting
- Deployment automation
- Configuration scripts
- System integration
- Environment setup
