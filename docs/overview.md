# FreeIPA Workshop Deployer

This project provides a comprehensive deployment and configuration solution for FreeIPA (Free Identity, Policy, and Audit) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It leverages Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for system configuration, ensuring a repeatable and automated deployment process.

## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to simplify and automate the deployment of FreeIPA environments while ensuring consistency and security across different deployment scenarios.

## Problems Solved

- **Complexity in Manual Deployment:** Automates the deployment process, reducing the complexity and potential for human error.
- **Consistency Across Environments:** Ensures consistent deployment across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates easy scaling of FreeIPA deployments to accommodate growing needs.
- **Security:** Provides a secure and compliant deployment process, adhering to best practices for identity management.

## How It Works

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - Uses Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure on AWS, DigitalOcean, or kcli
   - Manages cloud resources and networking configurations

2. **System Configuration**
   - Employs Ansible to configure the FreeIPA server
   - Handles DNS setup, user provisioning, and certificate management
   - Ensures consistent system configuration across deployments

3. **Dynamic DNS Management**
   - Implements dynamic DNS management for flexible configuration
   - Supports various DNS providers and configurations

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Provides comprehensive testing procedures
   - Ensures proper functionality of all components
   - Validates deployments against best practices

5. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Sets up monitoring systems for operational visibility
   - Configures alerts for system health and performance
   - Enables proactive issue identification and resolution
